# Step 0
## Pre-Commit Hooks

Run the below 2 codes right after clone this repo from your terminal.
```
pip install -r common.txt
```

```
pre-commit install
```
The steps ensure to work pre commit hooks before you push the code to the repo.
By running "pre-commit install", it executes .pre-commit-config.yaml file, then, the yaml file sets up the git hook scripts.
After the command, 'pre-commit' runs automatically on "git commit"

</p>
The picture is actually running for this repo. So, the file checks 7 points (6 ids under the hooks and black)
Once, you change code on this repo and commit the changes through <br>

- git commit -m 'First Commit' on terminal <br>
- Click the "Commit" panel (the left side on Pycharm) <br>

Either way, it runs automatically like the below figure.

# Step 1
## Jenkins
Before downloading, Jenkins should check your PC system. <br>
If you don't have JAVA, you need to download JAVA and Git Bah. <br>
Then you check [System properties -> Environment Variables -> path], System variables has JAVA-HOME and right Path condition. <br>

### How to run Jenkins at localhost
- Download Jenkins <br>
1. Run the below code from your terminal(Pycharm)

```
java -jar jenkins.war
```
2. C:\Users\User\Desktop(Jenkins folder location) >java -jar jenkins.war
3. Open browser, Type below port number for Jenkins

```

localhost:8080
```
When using Jenkins, do steps 1, 2 and 3 every time. <br>

### How to ues Jenkins
When you open the dashboard, click New Item <br>

<p>
<img src="images/Jenkins-page.png" alt="Jenkins" width="400" height="300">
</p>

Look at the picture above <br>

- An item name = your project name
- Click Pipeline

Next step is What do you want to build. <br>

Please follow the picture below
<p>
<img src="images/jenkins-configure1.png" alt="Jenkins-configure1" width="400" height="300">
</p>

What do you want to run
- Set ***** (every minute) run

<p>
<img src="images/jenkins-configure2.png" alt="Jenkins-configure2" width="400" height="300">
</p>

Make Pipeline script
- Click try sample pipeline
- stage is title
- echo is comment

<p>
<img src="images/jenkins-configure3.png" alt="Jenkins-configure3" width="400" height="300">
</p>

Click Build Now you got the picture below <br>

<p>
<img src="images/jenkins_StageView.png" alt="stageView" width="400" height="300">
</p>

If the build is red, it's a failure. You should check the #number -> console output, then fix your code update and run it again.<br>

Next step, click the Pipeline Syntax <br>
- Checkout: Check out from version control
- SCM -> Git
- Repositories -> Git clone URL
- Credentials -> private access ID & password (Company project)
- Save it, get script
- bat -> for windows command (This time, build docker )


<p>
<img src="images/jenkins_pipeline.png" alt="pipline" width="400" height="300">
</p>

This time, created three build. First is "check it" for connect Git success. Second is "build" for create Git clone. Third is "unit test" for run unit test command.

# Step 2
## docker
Docker is a tool for running your applications inside containers and similar in concept to Virtual Machines (can be run on any OS).<br>
Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. <br>
- Download and install Docker <br>

You should create Dockerfile on your Pycharm. Docker file name MUST be 'Dockerfile'. <br>
- Dockerfile works top to bottom <br>
- Dockerfile reserved word are the picture below <br>

<p>
<img src="images/docker_reserved_word.png" alt="docker" width="400" height="300">
</p>

Created Dockerfile is the picture below <br>

<p>
<img src="images/dockerfile.png" alt="dockerfile" width="400" height="250">
</p>

### How to run docker
- Name and optionally a tag in the name:tag format (latest = NEW) <br>

```
docker build -t test:latest
```

```
docker images
```

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. <br>
<p>
<img src="images/docker_images.png" alt="docker images" width="300" height="100">
</p>

When you push your code to GitHub, GitHub will call jenkins and run docker for unit testing. <br>
